# Webapp

A scalable User Management Service built with Node.js and Express.js, supporting CRUD operations along with email verification during user registration. The infrastructure is deployed on AWS, provisioned using Terraform.

### Features
 - User Management: Provides complete CRUD functionality for managing user information.
 - Health Monitoring: Includes a dedicated endpoint to monitor the applicationâ€™s health and its connected services.
 - Secure Deployment: Ensures data protection through HTTPS using SSL certificates and customer-managed encryption keys.
 - Scalability and Reliability: Achieves high availability and scalability using managed instance groups and load balancers.
 - Event-Driven Architecture: Leverages AWS SNS and lambda Functions to send verification emails through Mailgun.

aws_profile    = ""
vpc_default    = ""
subnet_default = ""
artifact_path  = ""
ami_name       = ""
instance_type  = ""
region         = ""

db_user     = ""
db_password = "" 
db_name     = ""

source_ami_id   = ""
demo_account_id = ""
```
